        <h4>Reuters</h4>
        <p>The Reuters Corpus contains 10,788 news documents totaling 1.3 million words. The documents have been classified into 90 topics, and grouped into two sets, called "training" and "test"; thus, the text with fileid 'test/14826' is a document drawn from the test set. This split is for training and testing algorithms that automatically detect the topic of a document.</p>
