<p>Help, I need somebody</p>
<p>Help, not just anybody</p>
<p>Help, you know I need someone, help</p>
<p>When I was younger (So much younger than) so much younger than today</p>
<p>(I never needed) I never needed anybody's help in any way</p>
<p>(Now) But now these days are gone (These days are gone), I'm not so self assured</p>
<p>(I know I've found) Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors</p>
<p>Help me if you can, I'm feeling down</p>
<p>And I do appreciate you being 'round</p>
<p>Help me get my feet back on the ground</p>
<p>Won't you please, please help me</p>
<p>(Now) And now my life has changed in oh so many ways</p>
<p>(My independence) My independence seems to vanish in the haze</p>
<p>(But) But every now (Every now and then) and then I feel so insecure</p>
<p>(I know that I) I know that I just need you like I've never done before</p>
<p>Help me if you can, I'm feeling down</p>
<p>And I do appreciate you being 'round</p>
<p>Help me get my feet back on the ground</p>
<p>Won't you please, please help me</p>
