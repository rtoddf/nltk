<p>They're selling postcards of the hanging</p>
<p>They're painting the passports brown</p>
<p>The beauty parlor is filled with sailors</p>
<p>The circus is in town</p>
<p>Here comes the blind commissioner</p>
<p>They've got him in a trance</p>
<p>One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker</p>
<p>The other is in his pants</p>
<p>And the riot squad they're restless</p>
<p>They need somewhere to go</p>
<p>As Lady and I look out tonight</p>
<p>From Desolation Row.</p>
<p>Cinderella, she seems so easy</p>
<p>"It takes one to know one," she smiles</p>
<p>And puts her hands in her back pockets</p>
<p>Bette Davis style</p>
<p>And in comes Romeo, he's moaning</p>
<p>"You belong to Me I Believe"</p>
<p>And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend</p>
<p>You better leave"</p>
<p>And the only sound that's left</p>
<p>After the ambulances go</p>
<p>Is Cinderella sweeping up</p>
<p>On Desolation Row.</p>
<p>Now the moon is almost hidden</p>
<p>The stars are beginning to hide</p>
<p>The fortunetelling lady</p>
<p>Has even taken all her things inside</p>
<p>All except for Cain and Abel</p>
<p>And the hunchback of Notre Dame</p>
<p>Everybody is making love</p>
<p>Or else expecting rain</p>
<p>And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing</p>
<p>He's getting ready for the show</p>
<p>He's going to the carnival tonight</p>
<p>On Desolation Row.</p>
<p>Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window</p>
<p>For her I feel so afraid</p>
<p>On her twenty-second birthday</p>
<p>She already is an old maid</p>
<p>To her, death is quite romantic</p>
<p>She wears an iron vest</p>
<p>Her profession's her religion</p>
<p>Her sin is her lifelessness</p>
<p>And though her eyes are fixed upon</p>
<p>Noah's great rainbow</p>
<p>She spends her time peeking</p>
<p>Into Desolation Row.</p>
<p>Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood</p>
<p>With his memories in a trunk</p>
<p>Passed this way an hour ago</p>
<p>With his friend, a jealous monk</p>
<p>He looked so immaculately frightful</p>
<p>As he bummed a cigarette</p>
<p>Then he went off sniffing drainpipes</p>
<p>And reciting the alphabet</p>
<p>You would not think to look at him</p>
<p>But he was famous long ago</p>
<p>For playing the electric violin</p>
<p>On Desolation Row.</p>
<p>Dr. Filth, he keeps his world</p>
<p>Inside of a leather cup</p>
<p>But all his sexless patients</p>
<p>They're trying to blow it up</p>
<p>Now his nurse, some local loser</p>
<p>She's in charge of the cyanide hole</p>
<p>And she also keeps the cards that read</p>
<p>"Have Mercy on His Soul"</p>
<p>They all play on penny whistles</p>
<p>You can hear them blow</p>
<p>If you lean your head out far enough</p>
<p>From Desolation Row.</p>
<p>Across the street they've nailed the curtains</p>
<p>They're getting ready for the feast</p>
<p>The Phantom of the Opera</p>
<p>In a perfect image of a priest</p>
<p>They're spoonfeeding Casanova</p>
<p>To get him to feel more assured</p>
<p>Then they'll kill him with self-confidence</p>
<p>After poisoning him with words</p>
<p>And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls</p>
<p>"Get outa here if you don't know"</p>
<p>Casanova is just being punished for going</p>
<p>To Desolation Row.</p>
<p>At midnight all the agents</p>
<p>And the superhuman crew</p>
<p>Come out and round up everyone</p>
<p>That knows more than they do</p>
<p>Then they bring them to the factory</p>
<p>Where the heart-attack machine</p>
<p>Is strapped across their shoulders</p>
<p>And then the kerosene</p>
<p>Is brought down from the castles</p>
<p>By insurance men who go</p>
<p>Check to see that nobody is escaping</p>
<p>To Desolation Row.</p>
<p>They be to Nero's Neptune</p>
<p>The Titanic sails at dawn</p>
<p>Everybody's shouting</p>
<p>"Which side are you on ?"</p>
<p>And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot</p>
<p>Fighting in the captain's tower</p>
<p>While calypso singers laugh at them</p>
<p>And fishermen hold flowers</p>
<p>Between the windows of the sea</p>
<p>Where lovely mermaids flow</p>
<p>And nobody has to think too much</p>
<p>About Desolation Row.</p>
<p>Yes, I received your letter yesterday</p>
<p>About the time the door knob broke</p>
<p>When you asked me how I was doing</p>
<p>Was that some kind of joke ?</p>
<p>All these people that you mention</p>
<p>Yes, I know them, they're quite lame</p>
<p>I had to rearrange their faces</p>
<p>And give them all another name</p>
<p>Right now I can't read too good</p>
<p>Dont send me no more letters no</p>
<p>Not unless you mail them</p>
<p>From Desolation Row.</p>
